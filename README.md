# randomPicker
A pair of graphical python programs I wrote in grade school to help my teacher's generate random student groups.

## DISCLAIMER
As I wrote this program around 7th grade, I can make no guarantees as to whether the libraries I used still work or not. Additionally, I do not program the same way I did back then lol, but I am still proud of what I accomplished learning at the beginning of my programming journey, and therefore I am archiving it publicly here :)
